    \begin{abstract}
      This article collects the work I did in order to support my
      Neural Network course final exam. The goal is to study neural networks
      using different training functions in order to test them against a dataset
      which holds datas about abalone. This short document describes our experience:
      we outline the problem and its application environment, the dataset used in
      experiments and a comparison of classification's results by different training functions.
      \end{abstract}
       
     

    \section{Problem description}
    
    We choose a classification problem in order to gain insights about neural networks.
    In particular, the dataset under study contains informations about abalone and
    the contained data comes from real measurements. The original article related to this
    dataset can be found in \cite{Nash-Sellers-Talbot-Cawthorn-Ford} and the dataset itself
    can be downloaded from \cite{ml-berkeley-dataset-url}. We report the original 
    problem description given in the article:
    \begin{quote}
    Predicting the age of abalone from physical measurements.  The age of
    abalone is determined by cutting the shell through the cone, staining it,
    and counting the number of rings through a microscope -- a boring and
    time-consuming task.  Other measurements, which are easier to obtain, are
    used to predict the age.  Further information, such as weather patterns
    and location (hence food availability) may be required to solve the problem.

    From the original data examples with missing values were removed (the
     majority having the predicted value missing), and the ranges of the
    continuous values have been scaled for use with an ANN (by dividing by 200).
    \end{quote}

    So, our goal is to classify abalone's age, in order to achieve this goal
    we tackle the dataset structure in the next section.

    \section{Dataset structure}

    The choosen dataset holds $4177$ samples and $8$ features variables and it 
    is structured according the following description:

    \begin{verbatim}
    Name            Data Type   Meas.   Description
    ----            ---------   -----   -----------
    Sex             nominal             M, F, and I (infant)
    Length          continuous  mm      Longest shell measurement
    Diameter        continuous  mm      perpendicular to length
    Height          continuous  mm      with meat in shell
    Whole weight    continuous  grams   whole abalone
    Shucked weight  continuous  grams   weight of meat
    Viscera weight  continuous  grams   gut weight (after bleeding)
    Shell weight    continuous  grams   after being dried
    Rings           integer             +1.5 gives the age in years
    \end{verbatim}

    With the following statistic summary:

    \begin{verbatim}
            Length  Diam    Height  Whole   Shucked Viscera Shell   Rings
    Min     0.075   0.055   0.000   0.002   0.001   0.001   0.002       1
    Max     0.815   0.650   1.130   2.826   1.488   0.760   1.005      29
    Mean    0.524   0.408   0.140   0.829   0.359   0.181   0.239   9.934
    SD      0.120   0.099   0.042   0.490   0.222   0.110   0.139   3.224
    Correl  0.557   0.575   0.557   0.540   0.421   0.504   0.628     1.0
    \end{verbatim}

    Response variable \emph{Rings} is the target of classification. 
    In our work we do not use each age value $v \in \lbrace 1, \ldots, 29 \rbrace$ 
    as classification bucket since having $29$ classes is quite dispersive.
    Thus we aggregate the available \emph{Rings} values in six classes, called \emph{One},
    \emph{Two}, \emph{Three}, \emph{Four}, \emph{Five} and \emph{Six} for simplicity, each of length five, 
    starting from zero, inclusive on the left. Formally, $\forall v \in Rings$ holds: 
    \begin{displaymath}
        \begin{split}
                v \in One &\leftrightarrow v \in \lbrace 0, \ldots, 4 \rbrace \\
                v \in Two &\leftrightarrow v \in \lbrace 5, \ldots, 9 \rbrace \\
                v \in Three &\leftrightarrow v \in \lbrace 10, \ldots, 14 \rbrace \\
                v \in Four &\leftrightarrow v \in \lbrace 15, \ldots, 19 \rbrace \\
                v \in Five &\leftrightarrow v \in \lbrace 20, \ldots, 24 \rbrace \\
                v \in Six &\leftrightarrow v \in \lbrace 25, \ldots, 29 \rbrace \\
        \end{split}
    \end{displaymath}

    \begin{table}
        \begin{tabular}{ c | c }
            Comprehensive distribution over $2924$ samples  &   Secret distribution over $1253$ samples \\
            \hline 
            \input{comprehensive-targets-histogram.tex} & \input{secret-targets-histogram.tex} \\
            \hline
        \end{tabular}
      \caption{On the left: histogram of samples used for training after aggregation.
        On the right: histogram of samples kept secret after aggregation.}
      \label{fig:comprehensive-histograms}
    \end{table}

    In \autoref{fig:comprehensive-histograms} we report the distribution of samples against
    the six defined classes: we take apart the dataset in two partitions, the bigger one is
    used for training, on the other hand the smaller one contains samples kept secret
    in order to study how well a training function works when it sees a new sample not
    trained for.

    Dataset partitioning has been performed using the uniform distribution, and we 
    repeat partitioning until distributions shown in \autoref{fig:comprehensive-histograms}
    appeared, such that distribution of samples used for training is quite similar
    to distribution of samples kept secret.

    \subsection{Project hosting}
    All the content of this project has been versioned in a \emph{Git} repository:\\
    \url{https://github.com/massimo-nocentini/quantitative-systems-analysis-exam}.\\

    Actually, the complete folder with Snort log cleaned files and the
    folder containing eps files aren't under version control since too
    large. To make it easier to download them we provide a
    \emph{Makefile} in \emph{pharo-smalltalk} directory under the
    project root, with the following rules:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{download-pharo}, will download a complete Pharo environment, about 20 MB;
    \item \textbf{run-pharo}, will run the downloaded Pharo image;
    \item \textbf{download-eps}, will download all eps files necessary
      for compiling this \TeX document, positioning the folder in the
      correct position, about 10 MB;
    \item \textbf{download-snort-logs}, will download the entire snort
      logs tree with the comprehensive set of eps not reported in this
      document, about 400 MB;
    \item \textbf{clean}, will remove all \TeX compilation output file
      and all files generated by running the Smalltalk test suite for
      our implementation, ie all plots and data files;
    \item \textbf{clean-all}, will remove eps and snort logs folders
      recursively, be sure to request this rule.
    \end{itemize}

    \newpage

    All code developed in \emph{Pharo Smalltalk} is freely available
    at
    \url{http://smalltalkhub.com/#!/~MassimoNocentini/QuantitativeSystemsAnalysisExam}
    and can be loaded directly via \emph{Monticello} smalltalk browser
    with the following message:
    \begin{adjustwidth}{-2cm}{}

	location: 'http://smalltalkhub.com/mc/MassimoNocentini/QuantitativeSystemsAnalysisExam/main'
	user: ''
	password: ''
\end{verbatim}
    \end{adjustwidth}    
    In order to use our implementation the package \emph{CommandShell}
    is required: to load it into the image, open the world menu (click
    on an empty point on the image) then navigate to \emph{Tools} and
    then \emph{Configuration Browser}, after that select the
    \emph{CommandShell} in the list and then click \emph{Install
      Stable Version}.
