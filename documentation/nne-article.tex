    \begin{abstract}
      This article collects the work I did in order to support my
      Quantitative Systems Analysis exam. The goal is to study
      resources usage respect a collection of user profiles, each one
      of them producing different network traffic and CPU/memory
      consumption patterns in different time windows. I performed some
      experiments repeating them over time, analyzing results with a
      piece of Smalltalk software, initially implemented for the
      problem at hand, but it turns out to be far more general.

    \subsection{Project hosting}
    All the content of this project has been versioned in a \emph{Git} repository:\\
    \url{https://github.com/massimo-nocentini/quantitative-systems-analysis-exam}.\\

    Actually, the complete folder with Snort log cleaned files and the
    folder containing eps files aren't under version control since too
    large. To make it easier to download them we provide a
    \emph{Makefile} in \emph{pharo-smalltalk} directory under the
    project root, with the following rules:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{download-pharo}, will download a complete Pharo environment, about 20 MB;
    \item \textbf{run-pharo}, will run the downloaded Pharo image;
    \item \textbf{download-eps}, will download all eps files necessary
      for compiling this \TeX document, positioning the folder in the
      correct position, about 10 MB;
    \item \textbf{download-snort-logs}, will download the entire snort
      logs tree with the comprehensive set of eps not reported in this
      document, about 400 MB;
    \item \textbf{clean}, will remove all \TeX compilation output file
      and all files generated by running the Smalltalk test suite for
      our implementation, ie all plots and data files;
    \item \textbf{clean-all}, will remove eps and snort logs folders
      recursively, be sure to request this rule.
    \end{itemize}

    \newpage

    All code developed in \emph{Pharo Smalltalk} is freely available
    at
    \url{http://smalltalkhub.com/#!/~MassimoNocentini/QuantitativeSystemsAnalysisExam}
    and can be loaded directly via \emph{Monticello} smalltalk browser
    with the following message:
    \begin{adjustwidth}{-2cm}{}
\begin{verbatim}
MCHttpRepository
	location: 'http://smalltalkhub.com/mc/MassimoNocentini/QuantitativeSystemsAnalysisExam/main'
	user: ''
	password: ''
\end{verbatim}
    \end{adjustwidth}    
    In order to use our implementation the package \emph{CommandShell}
    is required: to load it into the image, open the world menu (click
    on an empty point on the image) then navigate to \emph{Tools} and
    then \emph{Configuration Browser}, after that select the
    \emph{CommandShell} in the list and then click \emph{Install
      Stable Version}.
